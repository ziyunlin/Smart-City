				    nearby parking lots and the number of berths available in real time to facilitate motorists to prearrange travel and determine their parking location. 
                    The real-time parking data has also been accessible through the mobile app, very convenient and practical. Studies in the United States have shown

				    and processing system. When the household dumps the rubbish into the refuse chute, the waste is transported by high-pressure gas through
				    the underground pipeline to the central treatment collection station at a speed of 50 to 80 kilometers per hour, and then transported to 
				    the garbage incinerator by a large garbage truck. Staff reduction of 70%, and also save the needs of the garbage room. </p>
