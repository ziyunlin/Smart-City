	   urban refined area of 50,000 or more population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social integration with the core as a measured 
	   by commuting ties". This is according to the Cities -Ranked and rated second edition by Bert Sperling and peter sander. We will look in to this
	   book further when producing this report. Now let's talk what a smart city. A smart city should consist of ..</p>

	   <p id="videop2"><span>A</span>s you can see, in each word you see the word "Smart". Smart cities are ranked based on these nine factors. 
	   Each of these factors in a city are given points and based on the result, a city is ranked. Last year in the US, the state of Ohio won 
	   the smart city competition. Next we will look more in depth in to how and why cities are ranked this way. There is no actual definition 
	   for what a smart city is but all we can say is , if a city score well on the above nine methods, it can be considered a smart city. Now 
	   let's break down each of the nine aspects which make a city smart.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Economy & Jobs:</span> Smart cities have great household incomes, high employment rates, and there are a big variety of 
	   jobs people could choose from, and also industries that employ large numbers of people can be found inside Smart Cities.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Cost of living:</span> Cost of living displays overall cost of living and its main components compared to expected income 
	   levels and averages of the United States. Housing, taxes, necessities like food, transportation, utilities, healthcare, and miscellaneous
	   expenses are included in components. In Smart Cities, people live with better value for low cost of living compared to non-smart cities by 
	   having above average levels of the components mentioned above.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Climate:</span> Cities are ranked and rated under the key components of climate - temperature, humidity, precipitation, 
	   cloud cover, and hazards which gives us an understanding about the climate conditions of a city throughout a year. Climate ranking is 
	   based on desirable ranges of components of climate. Climatology is technical and complex to study.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Education:</span> This is an important aspect of any city. Primary/secondary schooling, undergraduate and graduate studies 
	   comes under education. Smart cities have high quality educational resources that contributes majorly for the quality of life for everyone 
	   living in a certain area.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Health & Healthcare:</span> Health and Healthcare are approached in two ways. Looking for hazards that cause health issues 
	   is the first approach and examining healthcare services and the costs of healthcare is the second. Air quality, spread of viral diseases 
	   and controlling them, availability of doctors, hospitals, medicine to treat large numbers of patients etc. are looked into. Smart cities 
	   have above average resources to provide the best healthcare.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Crime Prevention:</span> Availability of fully prepared law enforcement agencies with all the resources needed to prevent 
	   and counteract crime is a very important part of Smart Cities.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Transportation:</span> Commute times, mode of commuting to work, presence and use of public transportation, automobile costs 
	   are some of the factors that come under transportation. Smart Cities should have better/low cost public transportation systems, low emission 
	   of greenhouse gases from automobiles, low waiting time, availability of technological methods to check public transport schedules (Mobile apps) etc.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Cities & Leisure:</span> Leisure includes the number of dining restaurants and diversity of food available nearby, shopping malls, 
	   entertainment activities including movie theatres. Smart Cities should have a variety of entertainment and leisure activities and convenience 
	   to do shopping and eat from restaurants.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Arts & Culture:</span> The Arts & Culture category encompasses humanities, fine arts, science and history, museums, and performing 
	   arts. These assets provide education for children as well as adults and provides intellectually stimulating entertainment. A city with a long 
	   and great history, and contain museums with a diverse collection of artifacts and have performing art theatres that can entertain large numbers 
	   of people is eligible to become a Smart City under the arts & culture.
	   <br><br>
	   <span>Smart Cities & Quality of life:</span> Based mainly on personal experience, perception, and reviews from people who have visited a city. 
	   Some aspects to consider are physical attractiveness, heritage, and overall ease of living. A Smart City with a better quality of life will have 
	   better value for money when buying goods from stores, availability of convenient stores, a great heritage etc.
